# DNS and Routing

Since `odd-box` routes based on hostnames, your machine must resolve those names correctly. Options include:

- **Host file entries:** Point domains to `127.0.0.1`.
- **localtest.me:** Use for testing (e.g., `my-site.localtest.me`).
- ***.localhost:** Use for testing (e.g., `my-site.localhost`).
- **Custom DNS:** For advanced users with DNS server control.
