## Getting Started

### Creating a config file

You can generate a basic "odd-box.toml" config file to get started:
```
odd-box --init 
```

From here, you can either open up the config file in your favorite editor, or just run odd-box and open your browser going to http://localhost:1234 where you can configure odd-box thru its web-interface.

Please see the configuration page for details around which settings are available
