# Performance

`odd-box` is designed primarily for local development rather than production use. While we strive to keep performance efficient, achieving top-tier speeds is not a primary focus at this time. 

That said, for local projects and testing, `odd-box` aims to be "blazingly fast." Feedback on performance is always welcome as the project evolves.
