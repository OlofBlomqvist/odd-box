# ======================================================================================================
# This is an initial odd-box configuration file, it was generated using the './odd-box --init' command.
# It contains a very basic setup of all three types of services that odd-box can provide.
# For simplicity, this file should be named odd-box.toml so that odd-box can find it automatically
# when you run the './odd-box' command.

# More information about which settings are available can be found at
